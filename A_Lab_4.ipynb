        "1.   Recursive descent is a top-down parsing algorithm that reads the input from left to right while building the parse tree from the top. For each terminal and non-terminal entity, it employs processes. This parsing method creates a parse tree by recursively processing the input; this backtracking may or may not be necessary. However, the grammar that goes along with it (if left unadjusted) cannot prevent backtracking. An example is *predictive parsing*\n",

The backtracking problem is not present in the predictive parser. The predictive parser employs a look-ahead pointer, which directs attention to the next input symbols, to carry out its functions. The predictive parser imposes various restrictions on the grammar and only accepts a type of grammar known as LL(k) grammar in order to make the parser backtracking free.\n",
        "4.   LL Parser. LL grammar is accepted by an LL Parser. LL grammar is a subset of context-free grammar, however it has a few limitations to make it simpler and easier to implement. Both recursive-descent and table-driven methods can be used to implement LL grammar. LL stands for LL parser (k). The left-most derivation is represented by the second L in LL(k), the input is parsed from left to right by the first L in LL(k), and k itself denotes the number of look-aheads. Since k =Â 1, LL(k) can alternatively be represented as LL (1).\n",
